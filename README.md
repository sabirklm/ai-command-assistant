# AI Command Assistant
Convert natural language into **safe, executable CLI commands** using a local Ollama model.
Example:
```bash
njs run "commit my code with commit message setup completed"
```
Generates:
```bash
git commit -m "setup completed"
```
Then executes it after user confirmation.
---
## Why this exists
Typing commands is fast — remembering exact syntax is not.
AI Command Assistant lets you:
* describe what you want in plain English
* see the generated command
* approve it
* execute it safely
All **offline**, **local**, and **private** using Ollama.
---
## Features
* 🧠 Natural language → CLI command generation
* 🔐 Safety allow-list for supported tools
* 👀 User confirmation before execution
* ⚡ Uses local Ollama (no cloud, no data leak)
* 🖥️ Works with git, npm, flutter, docker, and more
---
## Requirements
* Node.js 18+
* Ollama running locally
```bash
ollama serve
```
---
## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabirklm/ai-command-assistant.git
cd ai-command-assistant
npm install
npm install -g .
```
---
## Usage
```bash
njs run "check git status"
njs run "commit my code with commit message setup completed"
njs run "create a new flutter app"
njs run "install react using npm"
```
---
## Safety Model
* Commands are generated by AI
* Only allow-listed tools are executed
* User confirmation is required before execution
This prevents destructive or unsafe commands.
